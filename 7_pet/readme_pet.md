Notes: the PET systems are not the exact PET ones but approximations.

## Exercice 1: Philips VEREOS PET system with F18 source 

This simulation contains: a PET imaging system, a waterbox with a sphere inside that contains F18 activity source. The output of the simulation is a file that contains Hits and Singles recorded by the PET. This file is analysed by the provided notebook. 

## Exercice 2: Siemens Vision PET system with Ga68  source

This simulation use another PET system, the Siemens Vision, with a different source, Ga68. 

Create another notebook inspired from the first one to analyse the difference between the two PETs.
